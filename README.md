  Mini-games that pop up while Claude Code thinks...

Built with Tauri v2. macOS only (for now).

## Games

| Game | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Typing Test | Monkeytype-style — type words, see your WPM and accuracy |
| Math | Mental arithmetic — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division |
| Snake | Classic snake on a canvas — arrow keys or WASD |
| Reaction | Wait for green, click as fast as you can |
| Memory | Flip cards and match pairs before time runs out |
| Stroop | Name the ink color, not the word — tests your focus |

A random game is picked each time (never the same one twice in a row). Stats persist across sessions.

More games coming — this project is actively expanding.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install whoisyurii/tap/microtaskrr
brew services start microtaskrr
```

This installs the binary, configures Claude Code hooks, and starts the background service.

### Shell script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whoisyurii/microtaskrr/main/install.sh | bash
```

**That's it.** Open a new Claude Code session, send a prompt, and a game appears.

Press **Esc** to dismiss and return to your terminal.

## Status bar & no Dock

The app does **not** appear in the macOS Dock. It lives in the **menu bar** (status bar) as a tray icon.

You can **pause** it by choosing "Sleep for..." from the tray menu (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h).

## Build from source

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoisyurii/microtaskrr.git && cd microtaskrr
npm install
npm run build
cd src-tauri && cargo build --release && cd ..
```

Then install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp src-tauri/target/release/microtaskrr ~/.local/bin/microtaskrr
```

And add the hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.local/bin/microtaskrr show &"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.local/bin/microtaskrr show &"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Start the background process:

```bash
~/.local/bin/microtaskrr &
```

## How it works

```
Claude Code CLI                    microtaskrr (Tauri app)
     |                                  |
     | UserPromptSubmit hook            |
     |--- microtaskrr show ----------->| show window, start random game
     |                                  |
     | PreCompact hook                  |
     |--- microtaskrr show ----------->| (also triggers on context compaction)
     |                                  |
     | (Claude thinking...)             | (user plays game)
     |                                  |
     |                                  | user presses Esc
     |                                  | hide window, restore focus to terminal
```

- Tauri v2 app with system tray, persistent background process
- Single-instance plugin forwards CLI args (`show`/`hide`) to the running process
- Claude Code hooks trigger `show` on every prompt submission and context compaction
- User dismisses with **Esc** when done (focus returns to terminal automatically)

## Uninstall

If installed via Homebrew:

```bash
brew services stop microtaskrr
brew uninstall microtaskrr
```

If installed via shell script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whoisyurii/microtaskrr/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```
